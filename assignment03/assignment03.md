# EMBSYS100 - AU19 ASSIGNMENT 03
### Goal
The goals for the assignment this week:
1. Become familiar with C programming language’s pre-processor, volatile directive, and how GPIOs work.
2. Explore using the STM32MXCube tool to generate code for the evaluation board.

### Problems:
1. Morse Code is considered a sequence of binaries. Please read about Morse Code and share the following findings:  

* a. What is Morse Code?  
__Morse code is a character encoding scheme used in telecommunication that encodes text characters as standardized sequences of two different signal durations called dots and dashes.__  

* b. Who developed Morse Code?  
__It is developed and improved by many people, Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail are considered as main contributors.__
2. Using the International Code below, please write a small program to present your first name with Morse Code using the user LED on our Nucleo-F401RE evaluation board.

  3. Bonus:  
* a. Use the STM32CubeMx tool to generate the boiler plate code for controlling the LED
* b. Implement a simple blinking LED program using the code generated by the tool.
* c. For Setup:
i. Install the tool (available under the “general” folder in Canvas).
ii. Install JRE if it prompts for it.
iii. Reference manual for the STM32CubeMX tool
